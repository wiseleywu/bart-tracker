# bart-tracker

This is a personal project to create a database to keep track of some metrics (though mostly issues) from BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit). The database will be used to generate real time dashboard with historical metrics so people (mostly me) could be aware of what kind of issues are plaguing our commute system.
